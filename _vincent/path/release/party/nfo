       |   a logo after four years

       '   this  prod  really  didn't  have a
       '   finally we debut our own snyhtesi-
           zer.  it has been growng over  the
           last  year  or so  and  is finally
           ready to use. having our own synth
           enabled a more  flexlible workflow
           especially for our  musician  drb,
           who  co-authored the synth.  it is
           named  'blankenhain'  after a city
           we  passed   driving  to  deadline
           party while discussing the synth's
           design.

           we  also  finally  got ourselves a
           logo -- after four years. but this
           is  not something  to handle half-
           heartedly

           even though we were all quite busy
           earning   bachelors's  degrees  or 
           generally being involved in acade-
           mia, we definetally wanted to make
           an intro again for revision. since
           some of us  are going to be spread
           'round  the globe soon  our future
           is  unclear. despite  that we made
           good  progress  early on  and  had
           content ready sooner than ever.

           nevertheless for the last days be-
           fore the party, there was a  l o t
           of work left. the new synthesizer
           needed an  exporter still  and had
           yet to be included in the runtime.
           after few to  no sleep on te first
           night at the party  we deemed our-
           selves almost done.  little did we
           know! in the last hours before the
           compo, everything that was dear to
           us broke to  pieces and  we hat to
           hunt  down some really nasty floa-
           ting-point specifics  in  our com-
           pile chain.  but in the end we ma-
           naged to get it all  done in  time
           and had a wonderful party!
      
           we want to thank urs, las and cupe
           from mercury,  boyc/conspiracy and
           cryptic/approximate for their kind
           and swift help with out intro.

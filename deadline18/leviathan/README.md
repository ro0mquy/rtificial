# Leviathan 2.0
The new generation of 4k intro frameworks. Currently very early in development but seems stable and usable enough give for testing.

## Acknowledgements
* Rimina for initial inspiration and OpenGL debug functions.
* LJ for giving information about some nice hacks!
* Fizzer for giving me help actually implementing those hacks.
* iq for the original framework.
* Mentor and Blueberry for Crinkler.
* LLB for Shader Minifier. This fork is used in the framework: https://github.com/armak/Shader_Minifier.
* Numerous people for various resources and information: auld, ps, cce, msqrt, ferris, yzi, las to name a few.

## Compatibility
Works in all versions of Visual Studio 2015. Probably in 2013 and 2017 as well but not tested.

## Configurations
This section describes the different build configurations available from Visual Studio IDE
### Release
The real deal. No-nonsense max crinklering with minimum extra. Use this for occasional testing and your final releases (the compression WILL take a while).
### Snapshot
Use for general development. Only minimal crinklering but nothing extra included. Useful still for keeping track of relative size changes. This configuration overwrites Release configuration binaries, but doesn't generate and overwrite crinkler report.
### Debug
By default includes some debug options, especially for OpenGL. Check out debug.h for more.
### Editor
Creates a bigger exe similar to Debug, but with keyboard controls for pausing and seeking around temporally. Reguires a pre-rendered copy of the audio track used (well, not a must but...). Overwrites Debug configuration binaries.

## Build Flags
This section describes the preprocessor definitions available for various features and size optimizations.
### OPENGL_DEBUG
Checks for shader compilation errors on initialization. Also enables to use the CHECK_ERRORS macro on debug.h. You want to leave this disabled in the final release obviously.
### FULLSCREEN
Changes the display mode to fullscreen instead of a static window. You want to use this in your final release but probably not while developing and debugging. Disabling this saves around 20 bytes.
### DESPERATE
Enabling this disables message handling, which isn't strictly necessary but makes running the intro much more reliable and compatible. Enabling this saves around 20 bytes.
### BREAK_COMPATIBILITY
Enabling this uses a pixel format descriptor that uses parameters that are mostly zeroes. This improves the compressability at the cost of violating the API specifications. You might be able to run your intro currently, but might break in the future or on other peoples' configurations right now. Enabling this saves around 5 bytes.
### TWO_PASS
Enables using the OpenGL backbuffer as a framebuffer and texture to perform simple post processing or other functionality.
### USE_MIPMAPS
Generates mipmaps for the backbuffer texture.
### USE_AUDIO
Disabling this doesn't include or init 4klang at all.
### NO_UNIFORMS
Enables using the gl_Color vertex attribute to pass variables to the shader instead of the usual uniform uploading. This saves one function import and around 10 bytes.

## TODO
* Fix warnings (well, SOME of them).
* Automatically dump audio in Editor mode if no .wav already exists.
* Support for more softsynths?
* Editor mode overlays (non-interactive seekbar, etc.).
* More preprocessor macros for additional shader passes.
* Make the Debug configurations generate some actually useful debug info.
* Maybe figure out something better to replace #define hell...

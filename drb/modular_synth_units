Units or effects to build for modular demo synth

MODULAR UNITS INTERNAL:
-Re-Normalisation: Build some for-loop that normalizes the output
if it is > 0db. May be switched on through button. Is neccessary almost
everywhere. Brick Wall Limiter pretty much (eg in Filter)


Please Build for every unit: 
Visual Feedback if Input is Midi or Audio-Stream
Visual Feedback if Output is Midi or Audio-Mono or Audio-Stereo
Little Paniq Button

LFO-Options have to be discussed. I Advice a design decision

A tool (either stand alone or vst) to approximate the music filesize is necessary.
The file location of the .als file would be given and on demand (button) the filesize would be calculated. bash script is fine too.

- Subtractive Synth
- Volume
- Panning with Option Mono from Channel L, R, L/R and width
- Tube Overdrive
- Bit Crush
- Hard Overdrive / Fuzz
- (Stereo) Delay
- Ping Pong Delay
- Noise Generator (white / Pink / Volume)
- Additive Synth
- Chorus
- Flanger
- Vinyl Slowdown (Parameter: Speed, TriggerButton to continue again)
- (Regular) Reverb (Plate? whatever)
- Spring Reverb (google it, sounds significantly different)

- Sampler from File (Input: Wav, MP3, Ogg, Flac; best via Drag and Drop or Browse Folder Structure; Slider for Compression and 
visual Feedback with estimated extra File size i.e. size of compressed sample.
- Filter (High, Low, Band with Options Frequency and Resonance)
- Compressor with usual interface if possible and SideChain-Option if Possible 
- Noise Gate (Threshhold Frquency Parameter)
- Rythmic Gate (BPM Synced, shows 1x16 grid with clickable squares that imply gating. Also Slider for "Floor" i.e. Volume when Gate is Active, default -inf)
- Limiter with some Feedback as to RMS and abs Vol before and after Limiting. 
- AutoPan (maybe as LFO option in regular PAN effect

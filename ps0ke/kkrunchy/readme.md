## kkrunchy binaries -- gotta collect them all

This is our collection of different binary versions of the exe packer [kkrunchy](http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/). Keeping different versions is useful when one version breaks your binary by compressing it.

## `kkrunchy.bat`
This batch script runs all our `kkrunchy` versions against `strahlenwerk_runtime`s `Debug` and `Release` configuration so that you can find the one that works and compresses best.

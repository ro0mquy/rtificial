## kkrunchy binaries (and other exe packers) -- gotta collect them all

This is our collection of different binary versions of the exe packer [kkrunchy](http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/) and BeroExePacker (http://www.rosseaux.net/page40_BeRoEXEPacker.html). Keeping different versions is useful when one version breaks your binary by compressing it.

## `kkrunchy.bat`
This batch script runs all our exe packer versions against `vinyl`s `Debug` and `Release` executables of one build configuration so that you can find the one that works and compresses best.

Usage: `kkrunchy.bat <config>` where `config` is a build configuration, which might be one of `4klang`, `V2`, `vorbis` and more. See `rtificial/vinyl/README.md` for all available configurations.
